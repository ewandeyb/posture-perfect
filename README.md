### **Vision-Based Rehabilitation Assistance Using Pose Estimation and Motion Tracking**

**About the Project**
This project proposes a computer vision system designed to assist individuals recovering at home by providing automated movement tracking and corrective feedback through a camera interface.It addresses the lack of real-time supervision for home patients, aiming to prevent improper movement and delayed recovery.

**Key Features & Techniques**
The system implements several Image and Video Processing (IVP) techniques:
* **Video Enhancement:** Improves video quality to handle varying lighting conditions.
* **Segmentation & Motion Tracking:** Isolates the user's body from the background and extracts joint keypoints across video frames.
* **Form Analysis:** Computes joint angles and uses classification models to determine if exercises are performed with correct form.
* **Utility Functions:** Includes repetition counting for exercise tracking and video compression for efficient storage.

**Methodology**
To ensure clinical relevance and accuracy, the selection of exercises, correctness thresholds, and feedback design are guided by consultations with licensed physical therapists.
